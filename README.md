# AR-VR-project-Magic-Draw

**Project:** 

An AR application of children's enlightenment education based on Android system

**Tools:** 

Unity 3D + Android Studio + EasyAR SDK

**Targets:**

What I hope to create is a mobile phone app that parents or teachers can use to help preschoolers learn about reality. An adult can hold a card with an item name and scan it with a phone camera to show a model of the item to the child. If time permits, I would like to add gesture interaction so that the child can easily observe any part of the object.
